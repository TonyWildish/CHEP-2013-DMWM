\subsection{Data Aggregation Service}
The Data Aggregation Service (DAS) \cite{DAS} is critical component of CMS Data
Management System. It provides ability to query CMS data-services via uniform
query language without worrying about security policies and differences in
underlying data representations. When physiscists posses a question like {\it
"Find me files from RelVal dataset at certain site"}, DAS converts it into
series of requests to underlying CMS data-services. Upon processing requested
data DAS takes care of aligning naming conventions, data convertion into common
JSON format and aggregating data on a requested entity key, e.g. file names.
As a result user gets back aggregated record across participated
data-providers.  This workflow fits really well into LifeCycle design which
utilize DAS as cross-check validation tool for its components.

Within LifeCycle Agent DAS was configured to talk to participated DBS and
Phedex systems. The queries were processed via DAS engine and presented back
to the client. Since original data were requested within LifeCycle Agent itself
we were able to compare initial data set with DAS output. This represents a
unit test for data injection and retrival through different systems. We
compared the following set of data:

\begin{itemize}
\item dataset injection into DBS system
\item block and files injection into DBS and Phedex systems
\item site content represented in Phedex system
\end{itemize}
